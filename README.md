Are You Ready to Control Fluid Flow?
Code Explanation.........
The code simulates fluid flow (specifically solving the Navier-Stokes equations) to model the movement of fluid in a pipe under the influence of pressure and velocity. This simulation is performed using numerical methods to solve the fluid motion equations. Below is an explanation of the main parts of the code:

Defining Parameters and Initial Conditions:

Nx, Ny: The number of grid points in the horizontal and vertical directions. These grids are the specific points where the equations are solved.
dx, dy: The grid spacing in the horizontal and vertical directions.
dt: The time step, which significantly impacts the stability of the simulation.
rho: The fluid density.
mu: The dynamic viscosity of the fluid, which affects friction and flow.
U and V: Matrices for the fluid velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions.
P: The matrix for fluid pressure.
T: The matrix for temperature (if required).
Boundary Condition Application Function:

apply_boundary_conditions: This function applies boundary conditions to velocity and pressure. Typically, in pipes, the "no-slip" condition (i.e., zero velocity at the boundaries) is used, which is also applied in this code.
Updating Velocity and Pressure:

Velocity: In this step of the motion equations, the fluid velocity is updated. Central difference numerical methods are used to compute velocity variations at different grid points.
Pressure: The Navier-Stokes equation is used to update the pressure. The pressure variations over time drive the fluid movement. In this simulation, the pressure is updated using Poisson-type equations.
Fluctuations in Velocity and Pressure:

In each step of the simulation, velocity and pressure are continuously updated until a stable state is reached. These fluctuations in boundary conditions, time steps, and the fluid grid result in variations in the velocity and pressure profiles.
Observing Results:

After the simulation, the results are presented in the form of graphs showing velocity and pressure at different time steps.

Objective: The objective of this simulation is to model and study fluid flow under the influence of pressure and velocity in a pipe. The Navier-Stokes equations are used to explain the fluid behavior in this system. The simulations are solved numerically, and central difference methods are used to solve the motion equations.

Parameters and Initial Conditions:

Number of spatial grids: 100x100
Fluid density: 1.0
Viscosity: 0.1
Time step: 0.01
Boundary conditions: Zero velocity at the boundaries (no-slip condition)
Methods:

Solving the Navier-Stokes Equations: The Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow are solved numerically. These equations are continuously updated to simulate the fluid flow behavior.
Modeling Pressure and Velocity: Pressure is updated over time to drive the fluid flow. Velocity is calculated using central differences for spatial and temporal derivatives.
Simulation with Small Time Steps: Small time steps are used to avoid excessive oscillations and instability in the simulation.
Results:
During the simulation, fluctuations in velocity and pressure at different points were observed. These fluctuations are naturally due to the effects of pressure and boundary conditions. In the initial parts of the pipe, where velocity is higher, more fluctuations are observed. Additionally, fluctuations are amplified by the interaction between pressure and velocity at different points in the pipe.

Conclusion:
The simulation of fluid flow in a pipe demonstrated that fluctuations in velocity and pressure occur due to the application of boundary conditions and pressure variations. These fluctuations are a natural consequence of the fluid dynamics and the influence of various parameters in the simulations. To improve the stability of the simulation, smaller time steps can be used, or more accurate methods can be applied to solve the equations.

Suggestions for Improvement:

Use more advanced methods for applying boundary conditions.
Reduce the time step to decrease fluctuations.
Use more complex models to achieve more accurate results.
