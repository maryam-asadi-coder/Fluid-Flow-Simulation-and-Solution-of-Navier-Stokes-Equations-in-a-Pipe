Are You Ready to Control Fluid Flow?
Code Explanation.........
The code simulates fluid flow (specifically solving the Navier-Stokes equations) to model the movement of fluid in a pipe under the influence of pressure and velocity. This simulation is performed using numerical methods to solve the fluid motion equations. Below is an explanation of the main parts of the code:

Defining Parameters and Initial Conditions:

Nx, Ny: The number of grid points in the horizontal and vertical directions. These grids are the specific points where the equations are solved.
dx, dy: The grid spacing in the horizontal and vertical directions.
dt: The time step, which significantly impacts the stability of the simulation.
rho: The fluid density.
mu: The dynamic viscosity of the fluid, which affects friction and flow.
U and V: Matrices for the fluid velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions.
P: The matrix for fluid pressure.
T: The matrix for temperature (if required).
Boundary Condition Application Function:

apply_boundary_conditions: This function applies boundary conditions to velocity and pressure. Typically, in pipes, the "no-slip" condition (i.e., zero velocity at the boundaries) is used, which is also applied in this code.
Updating Velocity and Pressure:

Velocity: In this step of the motion equations, the fluid velocity is updated. Central difference numerical methods are used to compute velocity variations at different grid points.
Pressure: The Navier-Stokes equation is used to update the pressure. The pressure variations over time drive the fluid movement. In this simulation, the pressure is updated using Poisson-type equations.
Fluctuations in Velocity and Pressure:

In each step of the simulation, velocity and pressure are continuously updated until a stable state is reached. These fluctuations in boundary conditions, time steps, and the fluid grid result in variations in the velocity and pressure profiles.
Observing Results:

After the simulation, the results are presented in the form of graphs showing velocity and pressure at different time steps.
